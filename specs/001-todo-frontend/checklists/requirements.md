# Specification Quality Checklist: Todo Application Frontend User Interface

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality: PASS
All requirements meet content quality criteria. The specification focuses on user value and business needs without leaking implementation details.

### Requirement Completeness: PASS
All 34 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain. All success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic. Edge cases are well-defined.

### Feature Readiness: PASS
All user stories (P1 and P2 priorities) have clear acceptance scenarios. The specification is ready for planning phase.

## Notes

- Specification successfully created and validated
- Ready to proceed to `/sp.plan` phase
- No architectural decisions require ADR documentation at this stage
